# Task stream

Task stream is a list of tasks ordered by the time of arrival.

Task streams are organized in a hierarchy: a parent stream can receive tasks from multiple child streams.

## Structure

* URL - the url for downloading the tasks
* Default task duration - the time interval in milliseconds that is used if the user doesn't specify the task duration
