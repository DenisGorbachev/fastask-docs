# Phrase

**Phrase** is either a single [word](Word.md) or a list of phrases separated by whitespace.

## Examples

* main
* add 2 2
* add (add 1 1) 2
* = (add 2 2) 4

## Notes

* Every word is also a phrase.
* Parentheses allow to group the words into phrases (informally: "(add 2 2)" is treated as a word)
* Yeah, it's a LISP.
