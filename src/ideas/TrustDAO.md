# TrustDAO

TrustDAO solves the problem of trust between people.

* Every current member gets 1 DAO token every day.
* In the event of arbitrage, every member can vote with the tokens.
  * But a malicious actor can buy a lot of tokens and influence the vote
    * So we need to make the tokens non-purchasable
* But it's trivial to create a new TrustDAO account (no KYC)
  * Introduce KYC?
    * But slower growth of the user base
    * But still possible to create a new identity
