# Programmer API drafts

"Write a function" is a function from {a description of two spaces} to {a description of paths from every point in the input space to any point in the output space}.

(islands and bridges) (points and paths) (states and transitions) (values and functions) (objects and morphisms)

## The Tale of Programming

A child is born. She is looking at the world, progressively refining her understanding through *distinctions*.

* Everything splits into nothing and something (true and false - booleans are born).
* Something splits into moments on a timeline (0, 1, 2, ... - numbers are born)
