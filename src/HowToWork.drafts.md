## How to work

"Working" is making products.

* Write down the name of your product.
* Come up with a list of different models for your product
  * Examples
    * Stone -> Weight
    * Stone -> Volume
    * Stone -> Density
    * Stone -> Type
    * Stone -> List of Atoms
    * Stone -> List of Molecules

## How to think

Thinking is "connecting the dots" - making links between objects. In order to think clearly, you should be able to imagine

There are two basic definitions:

* The objects are points in the space.
* The links are paths from one point to another.

Paths are points in the path space.

* Take a sheet of paper
* Write the title: "Space of points"
* Draw a point A
* Draw a point B
* Draw a line from A to B
* Take another sheet of paper
* Write on it: "Space of paths"
* Draw a point AB
* Realize that the point AB in the space of paths represents the line from A to B in the space of points

This observation is one of the most important ones in the whole of mathematics.
