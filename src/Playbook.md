# Playbook

Playbook is a project management system. It helps you to make decisions, verify them with simulations, send the tasks to [Tmesg](Tmesg.md).

## Benefits

* **Save time on micromanagement**: the tasks will be displayed in the web interface + sent automatically by the Telegram bot.
* **Write better plans**: each "business plan" will be very detailed - down to individual task level.
* **Change plans faster**: each team member will be able to suggest a change to the plan by sending a pull request on GitHub.
* **Show your plans**: each team member will be able to see the big picture (after a crash course in TypeScript ðŸ˜ˆ )
