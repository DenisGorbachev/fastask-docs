# How to make decisions

Better decisions = better life.

Imagine if:

* You decided to buy Bitcoin when its price was $10
* You decided to start Google in 1998
* You decided to read this book till the end...

If you want to make better decisions, this text is for you. It contains some math, but it's always accompanied by real-world examples.

Read on, and may the force be with you.

## Theory

Every decision is a choice between multiple options. Theoretically, you could just sort options by some property and pick the top #1. But reality is messy: sometimes you can't calculate the property value, sometimes the list of options is infinite. Is there a generic algorithm that we can apply in every possible situation?

The answer is **yes**, but it comes with a big **but**: you need to see the world differently in order to understand it.

So let's put on our mathematician's hat & learn some theory.

### Objects

Our world has multiple objects: houses, cars, people. We need objects to make our lives better. However, objects are hard to work with - for example, it's hard to move the houses, and it's hard to move the cars without gasoline.

Fortunately, we don't always need to work with objects - for example, we don't need to move the house to show it to a potential buyer. Instead, we can take photos of the house & list them on a marketplace. In the language of mathematics, we can use **models** of real objects.

### Models

Models are objects that maintain some properties of other objects, but are easier to work with. For example, a photo of the house is a model - it's not a real house, but it elicits the same emotions in the people who are looking at it. We can use the photos to filter out the bad-looking houses.

So we can make decisions faster using models instead of real objects. But how do we make sure that models represents the objects correctly? We can apply **tests** to compare them.

### Tests

Tests are logical predicates that determine whether something is true or false. We can use the tests to compare the objects & models. If they pass the same tests, they are equivalent.
