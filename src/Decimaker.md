# Decimaker

[Decimaker](CallToAction.md) is a system for making decisions in real life.

Decimaker helps you:

* Make decisions faster (less delays)
* Make decisions better (less mistakes)
* Make decisions stronger (less demotivations)

## How it works

* You write a function with the following signature:
  * Input is the current state (your life situation)
  * Output is an optimal action (what you should do in this situation)
* While writing the function, you use the utility functions from Decimaker library ([see documentation](CallToAction.md)).

You can also use Playbook to execute your function, display the optimal action (current task) and store its result in a database.

## Pricing

It's free!

But you have to learn programming.
