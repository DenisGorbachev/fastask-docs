# Task management

Zenbox unifies tasks & messages under a single request-response paradigm.

Zenbox requires you to submit task results, which are forwarded to external systems. For example, if the task were "Reply to email", the system would expect the task result to be an answer to the email, and it would send the answer on user's behalf via email server. This allows to use Zenbox as a proxy between you and the external task sources (email, messengers, Salesforce notifications, GitHub issues, Google Sheets rows, ...).

      * The user can freely edit the code
      * The user can save the new code only if it passes the typechecker
      * The user can close the editor if the current code has been saved ("complete the task early")
      * The editor will self-close after a timeout (can be adjusted as a separate task at the end of the day)
    * The user can react to the task in the following ways:
      * Provide a direct response
